# Submission Mapping (Automation Innovation Hackathon)

## Judge-aligned checklist

- [x] **Problem clarity**: Automation Copilot focuses on safe workflow generation + execution transparency.
- [x] **Innovation**: Guardrail-first workflow planning + live simulation audit trail in one lightweight UI.
- [x] **Technical execution**: Frontend MVP + Python planning API + TS orchestrator simulation service.
- [x] **Usability/demo**: 2-3 minute deterministic flow in README.
- [ ] **Impact metrics**: Add measured time-saved/error-rate benchmarks (next iteration).
- [ ] **Polish**: Add persistent templates and richer execution graph visualization.

## Demo script mapping

1. **Context (20s)**: teams lose time wiring brittle automations; we provide safe one-click workflow plans.
2. **Input (30s)**: set objective, trigger, action, guardrail.
3. **Plan generation (40s)**: show auditable steps and expected KPI targets.
4. **Simulation (30s)**: show deterministic execution trace and compliance guardrail pass.
5. **Architecture (30s)**: frontend + Python planner + TS orchestrator with CI + deploy-first loop.
6. **Roadmap (20s)**: add real connectors, model routing, benchmark dashboard.

## Submission assets checklist

- [x] Public GitHub repo
- [x] Live production URL (Vercel)
- [x] README with setup + demo flow
- [ ] Short demo video (<=3 min)
- [ ] Architecture diagram
- [ ] Final impact metrics snapshot
